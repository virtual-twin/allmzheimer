Welcome to allmzheimer's documentation!
------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is the documentation for the allmzheimer code, which is part of a current research project at the `Brain Simulation Section <https://www.brainsimulation.org/bsw/zwei/home>`_ at Charité Berlin (AG Ritter).
It is a supplementary resource in addition to the paper 'Biological database mining for LLM-driven Alzheimer’s Disease Drug Repurposing'.
This documentation provides you with an overview of the technology used for achieving the results presented in the paper and gives you all the information to replicate the results or to employ the modules for your own purposes.
While the scientific paper published along with this code is focused on Alzheimer's, the pipeline can be used to identify novel drug uses for any pathology.
If you have specific questions, suggestions or inquiries please visit :doc:`contact`.
If you want to contribute to the project by proposing your own code please visit :doc:`contributing`.


Enjoy your stay on our documentation page!
