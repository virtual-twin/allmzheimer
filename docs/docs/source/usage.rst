Usage
==============

While the scientific paper that was published along with this package is focused on Alzheimer's, the pipeline can be used to identify novel drug uses for any pathology.
This page describes how to employ the pipeline to leverage your drug repurposing research.

This pipeline will be either distributed as package or docker.
It should enable simple repurposing of the code for other pathologies than Alzheimer's.
