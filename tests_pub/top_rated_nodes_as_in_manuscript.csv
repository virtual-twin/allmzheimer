Additionally, it modulates G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, a key pathway involved in neuronal function and survival. Given its potential to impact multiple key pathways, I believe this drug is worth further testing for repurposing as an Alzheimer's treatment.","Indigotindisulfonic acid's ability to regulate cell migration, wound healing, and MAP kinase activity, which are all relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology, makes it a promising candidate for further testing.",0.9,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.5,0.85,0.9,0.95,0.8,0.9,"Approximately 4-9 minutes after indigotindisulfonate sodium is administered intravenously, its blue color is detectable at the ureteral orifices, enabling easier visualization for accuracy during medical procedures.[L42600] Although indigotindisulfonic acid and its salt form indigotindisulfonate sodium were initially acknowledged as pharmacologically inert, their use has been associated with cardiovascular effects.[A32489,A32490] Indigotindisulfonate sodium may lead to transient alpha-receptor stimulation, manifested as increased total peripheral vascular resistance, increased diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and increased central venous pressure with decreased cardiac output, stroke volume and heart rate.[A32489] The use of indigotindisulfonate sodium may lead to severe or life-threatening cardiovascular reactions such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, asystole, second-degree atrioventricular block, hypotension, elevation in blood pressure, bradycardia, and tachycardia.[L42600] Serious anaphylactic reactions with hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, or erythema have also been reported.[L42600] Also, the use of indigotindisulfonate sodium may interfere with light absorption and pulse oximetric methods.[L42600]","Indigotindisulfonic acid is a biologically inert blue dye.[A251380] After intravenous injection, indigotindisulfonic acid is excreted by the kidney through tubular secretion and, with its deep blue color, it enhances visualization of the ureteral orifices.[L42600] Because of this, indigotindisulfonic acid is used to identify ureteral patency in urologic and gynecologic procedures.[A251380]

Indigotindisulfonic acid may lead to the development of hypertension. It has been suggested that indigotindisulfonic acid inhibits endothelium-dependent relaxation at the level of nitric oxide generation and/or its release from the endothelium. Also, indigotindisulfonic acid appears to inhibit vascular guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle.[A32490]","The main application of indigotindisulfonic acid is localizing and visualizing ureteral orifices during cystoscopy and ureteral catheterization procedures [L2220]. Indigotindisulfonate sodium (salt form) is indicated for use as a visualization aid in the cystoscopic assessment of the integrity of the ureters in adults following urological and gynecological open, robotic, or endoscopic surgical procedures.[L42600]",,,
Darifenacin,0.82,"Darifenacin's ability to modulate the cholinergic system, which is involved in Alzheimer's disease pathology, makes it a strong candidate for repurposing. Additionally, its impact on lipid metabolic process and xenobiotic transport may also contribute to its potential therapeutic effects.","Darifenacin has a mechanism of action that targets the M3 muscarinic receptor, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, cholinergic. This process is relevant to Alzheimer's disease as it plays a crucial role in the decline of cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain. Additionally, Darifenacin's impact on lipid metabolic process and xenobiotic transport may also be beneficial in addressing the complex pathology of Alzheimer's disease.",0.9,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.9,"Darifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. <i>In vitro</i> studies using human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes show that darifenacin has greater affinity for the M3 receptor than for the other known muscarinic receptors (9 and 12-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to M1 and M5, respectively, and 59-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to both M2 and M4). Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of the urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Adverse drug effects such as dry mouth, constipation and abnormal vision may be mediated through effects on M3 receptors in these organs.","Darifenacin selectively antagonizes the muscarinic M3 receptor.

Selenious acid,0.82,"The drug Selenious acid has a high potential for Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing due to its impact on biological processes related to apoptosis regulation, inflammation modulation, and oxidative stress response. Its ability to regulate neuron apoptotic process, negative regulation of release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway suggests that it may have a therapeutic effect in reducing neuronal death and oxidative damage associated with Alzheimer's disease.","The drug Selenious acid has a high potential for repurposing as an Alzheimer's disease treatment due to its impact on biological processes related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, all of which are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.",0.9,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8,"Selenium is a component glutathione peroxidase, which protects cells from oxidative damage caused by peroxidases produced during cellular metabolism [L1910].

Selenium is needed to maintain the circulatory system. It also keeps the heart muscle and skin tissue healthy. It may also help in the prevention of cancer due to its stimulation of antioxidant activity and protection of cell membranes [L1916], [A32295].

Selenious acid preserves vitamin E, which improves the cell's antioxidant defense, and plays an important role in the structure of teeth [L1910].

Prolonged TPN (total parenteral nutrition) support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness. The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium [DB11135], [L1922].

Pediatric conditions, Keshan disease, and Kwashiorkor have been associated with low dietary intake of selenium. The conditions are endemic to geographical areas marked by low selenium content in the soil. Dietary supplementation with selenium salts has been reported to reduce the incidence of the conditions among affected children [L1922].","

Sodium selenite likely has the same mechanism of action as [DB11135].

The most important physiological role of sodium selenite is associated with its presence as an active component of many enzymes and proteins, in addition to its antioxidative role. Selenium has been shown to activate anticancer agents, prevent heart and vascular diseases, exhibit anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties, and to stimulate the immune system [L1930].

Its anticancer properties may be explained by the oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups. Tumor cells express free sulfhydryl groups (–SH) on the surface of their cell membranes and contribute to uncontrolled cell division. Only those compounds that can oxidize these groups to disulfides (S–S) may inhibit this process. Some organic forms of selenium, including selenocysteine, methylseleninic acid, and Se-methylselenocysteine have been established to be antioxidants. However, their anticancer mechanism is still not well understood [L1930].

Selenious acid, during an in vitro study, was found to stimulate hemoglobin synthesis in three different malignant erythroleukemia cell lines (MEL) [L1910]. It has also been shown to increase the release of interleukin 2 in a dose-dependent manner [A32297]. Interleukin-2 is made by a type of T lymphocyte (white blood cell). It increases the growth and activity of other T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes and this contributes to the development of the immune system [A32297].","
Selenium injection is indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Administration of selenious acid in TPN formulas helps to maintain plasma selenium levels and also to maintain endogenous stores to prevent deficiency [L1922].

Selenium compounds, such as selenium sulfide, are used topically in anti-dandruff shampoos and in cases of seborrhea [L1916]. 
 
For the purpose of brevity, selenite will the focus of discussion, and more information about selenium can be obtained at [DB11135].",,,
